!!! note
	Not all devices support external SD (ie, RTK Torch). This section applies only to devices that support an external SD card, and have one inserted.

!!! note
	Do you have a RTK Facet mosaic? Skip to the dedicated [RTK Facet mosaic](#rtk-facet-mosaic) section below as the menu options are different.

From the Main Menu, pressing 5 will enter the Logging Menu. This menu will report the status of the microSD card. While you can enable logging, you cannot begin logging until a microSD card is inserted. Any FAT16 or FAT32 formatted microSD card up to 128GB will work. We regularly use the [SparkX brand 1GB cards](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/15107) but note that these log files can get very large (>500MB) so plan accordingly.

- Option 1 will enable/disable logging. If logging is enabled, all messages from the ZED-F9P will be recorded to microSD. A log file is created at power on with the format *SFE_[DeviceName]_YYMMDD_HHMMSS.txt* based on current GPS data/time. The `[DeviceName]` is 'EVK', etc.
- Option 2 allows a user to set the max logging time. This is convenient to determine the location of a fixed antenna or a receiver on a repeatable landmark. Set the RTK Facet to log RAWX data for 10 hours, convert to RINEX, run through an observation processing station and youâ€™ll get the corrected position with <10mm accuracy. Please see the [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station) tutorial for more information.
- Option 3 allows a user to set the max logging length in minutes. Every 'max long length' amount of time the current log will be closed and a new log will be started. This is known as cyclic logging and is convenient on *very* long surveys (ie, months or years) to prevent logs from getting too unwieldy and helps limit the risk of log corruption. This will continue until the unit is powered down or the *max logging time* is reached.
- Option 4 will close the current log and start a new log.
- Option 5 will record the coordinates of the base antenna to a custom NMEA message within the log if the RTCM1005 or RTCM1006 message is received. This can be helpful when doing field work and the location of the base is needed; the log on the roving device will contain the location of the base preventing the user from needing to record the base location separately. The ARP is logged in a custom GNTXT,01,01,10 message as ECEF-X, ECEF-Y, ECEF-Z, Antenna Height. The Antenna Height will be zero if the data was extracted from RTCM1005.
- Option 7 will enable/disable creating a comma-separated file (Marks_date.csv) that is written each time the mark state is selected with the setup button on the RTK Surveyor, RTK Express or RTK Express Plus, or the power button on the RTK Facet.
- Option 8 will enable/disable the resetting of the system if an SD card is detected but fails to initialize. This can be helpful to harden a system that may be deployed for long periods of time. Without intervention, if an SD card is detected but fails to respond, the system will reset in an attempt to re-mount the faulty SD card interface.

!!! note
	If you want to log RAWX sentences to create RINEX files useful for post-processing the position of the receiver please see the GNSS Configuration Menu. For more information on how to use a RAWX GNSS log to get a higher accuracy base location please see the [How to Build a DIY GNSS Reference Station](https://learn.sparkfun.com/tutorials/how-to-build-a-diy-gnss-reference-station#gather-raw-gnss-data) tutorial.

## RTK Facet mosaic

The Data Logging menu on the RTK Facet mosaic is much simpler:

By default, only NMEA logging is enabled. The NMEA messages are those configured with the [Configure GNSS Messages](./menu_messages.md#rtk-facet-mosaic) menu.

Optionally, RINEX data can be logged. The file duration and logging interval can be configured:

The defaults set the logging interval to 30 seconds and the file duration to 24 hours. Logging will be continuous - a new file will be opened every 24 hours (cyclic logging).

If you are familiar with our other RTK products, you may be wondering where the "Log Antenna Reference Position from RTCM 1005/1006" has gone. On RTK Facet mosaic, the mosaic-X5 can log the Rover-Base Position in North-East-Up format via the proprietary RBP ($PSSN,RBP) NMEA message. We believe this trumps the position extracted from RTCM 1005/1006 on ZED-F9P platforms.

It is not possible to log RTCM on the mosaic-X5. Only SBF, RINEX and SBF (binary blocks) can be logged.

The RTK Everywhere Firmware does not currently provide a way of configuring the logging of additional SBF binary blocks. There are just so many, managing the menu choices alone would be quite a task. However, it is straightforward to define your own SBF Stream and point it at DSK1 for logging. Please see [Custom Configuration](./configure_with_ethernet_over_usb.md#custom-configuration) for more details.

[RxTools](./configure_with_rxtools.md) can read and analyse SBF log files, and convert the data into other formats.
